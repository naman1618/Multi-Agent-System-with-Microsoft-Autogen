# **Autogen Multi-Agent Framework: 
# **Customizable AI Teams for Any Use Case**

This repository demonstrates how to create **custom multi-agent systems** using **Autogen**. The scripts provided here allow agents to interact, collaborate, and solve complex tasks such as **document retrieval**, **code generation**, and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** processes. The system's flexibility enables you to create and configure specialized teams for **DevOps**, **creative content generation**, **AI-driven writing teams**, and more. With additional capabilities, these agents can even be used to **generate images** or **assist in decision-making**.

## **Overview**
This project leverages **Autogen** to build highly customizable **AI agents** that can be configured to handle a wide range of tasks. The agents collaborate to provide **automated solutions**, **retrieval-augmented generation**, and **code execution**. Moreover, these agents can be specialized to form various types of teams, such as:

- **DevOps teams**: Automate deployments, monitor systems, and handle infrastructure.
- **Creative teams**: Generate content, produce images, and design creative assets.
- **Writing teams**: Automate scriptwriting, article creation, and creative storytelling.
- **Marketing teams**: Perform customer segmentation, generate marketing content, and strategize campaigns.

The flexibility of these agents means they can be adapted to work in almost any domain, depending on the requirements and the integrations you build.

## **Features**
- **Conversational Agents**: Multi-agent systems that interact and solve complex tasks collaboratively.
- **Customizable Agent Configurations**: Easily set up agents to serve different functions, whether it's DevOps, creative writing, or technical problem-solving.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Use documents or knowledge bases as part of the agent's workflow.
- **Error-Handling and Resilience**: Agents handle errors gracefully, allowing robust conversation and task-solving capabilities.
- **Code Execution Capabilities**: Agents can write, run, and debug code collaboratively.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenAI API Key** (for LLM and embedding functions)
- **Autogen** (install via pip)
- **Chroma** (for vector storage and document retrieval)
- **Docker** (optional, if using Docker-based agents)

### **Installation**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naman1618/autogen-multi-agent-system.git
   cd autogen-multi-agent-system
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

## **Usage**

### **Creating Agents**
The provided scripts allow you to create a range of agents. For example, the `boss` agent acts as a task assigner, and the `coder` agent generates Python code. You can also configure specialized agents for content creation, code review, or marketing.

### **Running Conversations**
You can initiate conversations between agents using the provided functions. For example, use the `norag_chat()` or `rag_chat()` functions to start a conversation.

```python
from your_script import norag_chat, rag_chat

norag_chat()  # Start a basic conversation
rag_chat()    # Start a retrieval-augmented conversation
```

You can also configure the agents for more complex interactions using the `function_calling_rag_chat()` function.

## **Customization**

### **Creating New Agents**
The agents are flexible and can be customized to solve domain-specific tasks. Whether you're looking to build a DevOps team to automate deployments or a marketing team to generate content, you can easily modify the agent configurations. Here's an example of how you can define a **creative content generation agent**:

```python
from autogen import AssistantAgent

creative_agent = AssistantAgent(
    name="Creative_Content_Generator",
    system_message="You are a creative content generator, focused on creating captivating stories, blogs, and image descriptions."
)
```

### **Integrating Image Generation**
This framework can be extended to include **image generation capabilities** using tools like **DALL-E** or **Stable Diffusion**. By integrating these tools, your agents can generate images on the fly based on textual descriptions.

```python
from your_image_generation_script import generate_image

def image_generation_agent(description):
    return generate_image(description)  # Function to generate an image from text
```

## **Use Cases**

1. **DevOps Automation**: Agents can be configured to manage infrastructure, monitor systems, and handle continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
2. **Creative Teams**: Use agents to generate creative content, such as articles, images, or social media posts.
3. **AI-Driven Writing Teams**: Automate writing tasks like scriptwriting or copywriting.
4. **Marketing Teams**: Agents can handle customer segmentation, marketing content generation, and campaign strategy.
5. **Software Engineering Teams**: Automate code reviews, debugging, and collaborative code generation.

## **Future Enhancements**
1. **Integration with More AI Models**: Expanding the available models for specialized tasks like image generation or reinforcement learning.
2. **Dynamic Agent Roles**: Allowing agents to adapt to changing project requirements in real time.
3. **Improved Memory and Context Handling**: Adding more advanced memory functions so that agents retain information between tasks or conversations.
