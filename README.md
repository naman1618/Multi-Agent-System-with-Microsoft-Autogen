# **Autogen Multi-Agent Framework: Customizable AI Teams for Any Use Case**

This repository demonstrates how to create **custom multi-agent systems** using **Autogen**. The scripts allow agents to interact, collaborate, and solve tasks such as **document retrieval**, **code generation**, and **image/video generation**. The system's flexibility enables you to create teams tailored for **DevOps**, **creative content generation**, **AI-driven writing teams**, and more. These teams can easily integrate **image generation** models like **DALL-E 3** or video generation capabilities.

## **Overview**
This project leverages **Autogen** to build highly customizable **AI agents** that can be adapted to various tasks. In addition to tasks like document retrieval and code generation, this framework can also integrate **image** and **video generation** models such as **DALL-E 3**. These agents can be customized to form teams for **DevOps**, **creative content generation**, or **marketing**, depending on your use case.

## **Features**
- **Customizable Agent Configurations**: Easily set up agents for tasks such as **DevOps**, **image creation**, or **content generation**.
- **Image & Video Generation**: Use models like **DALL-E 3** for image creation or integrate other models for video generation.
- **Interchangeable Models**: Support for swapping out models for image, video, or text-based tasks.
- **Code Execution Capabilities**: Agents can generate, run, and debug code collaboratively.

## **Image and Video Generation**

This framework supports **image** and **video generation** through models like **DALL-E 3** or any other similar models, allowing you to build creative teams that can produce both visual and video content. You can easily configure the framework to add **DALL-E 3** or any other image generation model by updating the **OAI config list**.

### **Adding DALL-E 3 to the OAI Config List**
To add **DALL-E 3** to the list of models in the configuration, simply update the `config_list_from_json` to include DALL-E 3 alongside GPT-4 or any other model:

```json
{
    "models": [
        {
            "model": "gpt-4o",
            "api_key": "your_gpt4_api_key"
        },
        {
            "model": "dall-e-3",
            "api_key": "your_dalle3_api_key"
        }
    ]
}
```

This configuration allows you to use **DALL-E 3** for **image generation** by referencing it in the agent functions. The same structure can be used for **video generation** by integrating other video generation models (e.g., **RunwayML**, **DeepMind's Dreamer**).

### **Using Image/Video Generation in the System**
Once the models are added to the configuration, you can use them within the agent system to generate images or videos. Here's an example of how you can configure an agent for **image generation** using DALL-E 3:

```python
from openai import Image

def generate_image(prompt):
    response = Image.create(prompt=prompt, model="dall-e-3")
    return response["data"][0]["url"]

def image_generation_agent(description):
    return generate_image(description)  # Function to generate an image from text
```

### **Video Generation**
You can follow a similar approach for video generation. For example, if you are using **RunwayML** or another video generation model, you can add its API details to the `config_list` and create agents that handle video generation:

```python
def generate_video(prompt):
    # Example function for video generation using RunwayML API or other services
    response = RunwayML.create_video(prompt=prompt)
    return response["video_url"]

def video_generation_agent(description):
    return generate_video(description)
```

Both **image** and **video generation** can be easily integrated into the agent framework, allowing for a broad range of creative outputs.

## **Customization**

The agents are highly customizable. Depending on the use case, you can create agents that focus on:

- **DevOps Tasks**: Automate infrastructure deployments, monitor systems, and perform CI/CD.
- **Creative Teams**: Use agents to generate **images**, **videos**, **stories**, and other creative content.
- **Marketing & Writing Teams**: Create personalized marketing content, write blogs, or produce marketing strategies.

To switch models, you only need to modify the configuration list to include the models you want to use for different tasks (text, image, or video).

## **Use Cases**

1. **Creative Teams**: Generate images and videos for marketing or social media using **DALL-E 3** or other models.
2. **DevOps Teams**: Automate CI/CD pipelines, monitor server health, and manage infrastructure through collaborative agents.
3. **Marketing Content**: Use agents to create marketing campaigns, segment customers, and generate social media posts with both **text** and **image** content.
4. **Writing and Blogging Teams**: Automate article and scriptwriting, including SEO optimization and blog generation.

## **Future Enhancements**
1. **Integrating More Models**: Expand support for additional image and video generation models.
2. **Advanced Context Handling**: Enhance agent memory and context retention for long-running conversations.
3. **Dynamic Agent Roles**: Enable agents to switch between tasks dynamically based on project needs.
